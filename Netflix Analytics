SELECT MAX(date(date_added)) as newest_data_added
FROM "RodrigoBravo/Netflix"."netflix_titles_info";

#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order. 
SELECT title
FROM "RodrigoBravo/Netflix"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc;

#4. Who was the Director for the movie Nightbooks? 
SELECT director
FROM "RodrigoBravo/Netflix"."netflix_titles_info" a
LEFT JOIN  "RodrigoBravo/Netflix"."netflix_people" b
ON a.show_id = b.show_id
where a.title = 'Nightbooks'

#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made? 
SELECT title, release_year
FROM "RodrigoBravo/Netflix"."netflix_titles_info"
